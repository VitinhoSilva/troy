[**Spring boot 3.2.3**](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

[**JUnit**](https://junit.org/) - JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM.
